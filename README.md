# Warehouse app

## Intention
I wanted to make an application that could be used usefully for work of some business. The idea was to start develop an application for  logistics companies that could keep records of current stocks of goods in the warehouses, allow accounting receipts and disposals of goods and generate some reports for progress control.

## Description
Graphic design of application is made by [JavaFX](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/Main) platform. For storing data is used [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) server.

Login into system provides by entering own account's login and password in a special window when application starts.

If user password was forgotten, the application provides automatic sending of passwords by email to the employees email addresses which were inserted into database in time of the registration. A special dialog window was added.
